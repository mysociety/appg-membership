    "summary": "The question raised by the MP is about the potential impact of betting duty harmonisation on advertising for online gaming products. The MP's interests include membership on the Advisory Board of Steps Together Group Ltd, which focuses on addiction rehabilitation and treatment services. This connection makes the question relevant since the impact of betting could relate to addiction issues, aligning with Steps Together's mission. The MP has also received donations from 'Unite the Union', a trade union that may have stances on social issues such as gambling, possibly influencing the MP's inquiry. Lastly, the MP is an unpaid director of Addiction Recovery Now Ltd, an organization researching addiction issues, providing further relevance due to the possible effects of advertising level changes on addiction outcomes.",
