    "summary": "The MP has raised a question about the criteria for communities to qualify for capital grants for physical and social regeneration funding from local authorities. This question is considered relevant due to several of the MP's declared interests. These include being an advisor for the Local Government Association and a non-executive director at Wrekin Housing Group, which is a registered social landlord potentially benefiting from such funding. Additionally, the MP's roles as a Councillor and Council Leader at Telford and Wrekin Council, a member of the Telford Town Deal Board, and as an Honorary Vice President of the Local Government Association could impact their perspective or influence regarding local government funding policies and criteria. Furthermore, there's a monetary donation from Lord Kuldip Sahota linked to potential interests in local funding decisions, possibly affecting Telford's funding dynamics. The MP's roles and affiliations may connect them to funding processes and potential benefits from the grants for related projects or entities.",
