    "summary": "The MP is inquiring about the steps being taken to improve the use of innovative technologies for the treatment of glaucoma as part of the 10-Year Health Plan. The relevance arises from the MP's connections to two businesses: Alpha Eye Clinic LTD, where they serve as a director, meaning there's a potential conflict of interest because the question pertains directly to ophthalmology services, which mirrors the business interests of Alpha Eye Clinic LTD. Additionally, the MP's directorship at Sask Optics Ltd, a chain of optometry practices, further aligns with the nature of the question about technological innovation in glaucoma treatment, suggesting potential interests in gaining knowledge or influence in this area.",
