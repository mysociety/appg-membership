    "summary": "The interests flagged as relevant focus on the question about the effectiveness of using mediation in tax disputes because the MP is involved with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution Limited (CEDR) and is also the Chair of an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Taskforce. CEDR promotes mediation, and the MP's role suggests she might influence discussions advocating mediation from an ADR perspective. Though her taskforce work is specific to electricity network infrastructure, mediation is an ADR form applicable to tax disputes, linking her professional role to the subject matter of the question.",
