    "summary": "The MP's background as a Trade Union Official with the GMB Union and involvement in the GMB Parliamentary Group is relevant to the question about the Local Government Pension Scheme because trade unions often deal with employee rights and benefits, including pensions. Additionally, the MP has received monetary donations from unions like UNISON and GMB Midlands, both representing local government and public sector workers. The MP's question about whether local authorities can prevent new employees from joining the pension scheme may be influenced by these relationships, as it pertains to issues of worker rights and benefits, which are key interests of both GMB and UNISON. The trade unions' donations and involvement signify a vested interest in the pensions and benefits of local government employees who are represented by these unions.",
