The first interest is their role as a Director at Alpha Eye Clinic LTD, a company specializing in ophthalmology services, which directly relates to the question on preventing blindness due to glaucoma. The second interest is their directorship at Sask Optics Ltd, a chain of optometry practices, also relevant as these practices are involved in diagnosing and managing glaucoma. Both positions indicate that the MP has professional ties and possibly expertise in eye health, which could inform their interest in the health issue of glaucoma progression.",
