    "summary": "The MP has flagged several interests as relevant to their question about the proportion of migrants granted settlement after five and ten years. First, the MP has a professional interest in immigration through their work as a barrister, which might involve dealing with immigration law cases. This professional background could inform their queries about immigration and settlement issues. Second, the question aligns with the work typically associated with the Legal Aid Agency, which the MP seems to be connected to through their legal work, as it often deals with migrant rights and related issues. Finally, the MP's association with the Refugee, Asylum and Migration Policy Project (RAMP), from which they receive research services, suggests a direct link to migration policy interests and potentially informs the question being asked.",
