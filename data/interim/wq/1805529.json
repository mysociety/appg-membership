The MP received a donation from Yorkshire Land Limited, which is linked to the property and land industry. This industry could be significantly influenced by changes in the planning process.\n2. The MP has interests in property, with rental income in London, meaning changes in planning could impact their property value and related regulations.\n3. The MP is involved with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution Limited (CEDR) as Chair, Director, and Trustee, positioning them closely with mediation and dispute resolution themes.\n4. The MP also chairs an Alternative Dispute Resolution Taskforce within the Electricity Network Infrastructure, showcasing their expertise in mediation, which could translate to other sectors, like planning.",
