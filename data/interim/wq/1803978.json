    "summary": "The MP raised a question regarding the adequacy of funding for the British Transport Police. The following reasons were flagged as relevant:\n1. The MP received a donation from the RMT Union. This union represents transport workers who may be affected by or work with the British Transport Police, suggesting potential influence.\n2. Unite the Union, which is concerned with public sector funding and worker conditions, including issues related to the British Transport Police, might see this question as aligned with their interests.\n3. ASLEF, a union for train drivers and railway workers, has an interest in the safety and working conditions of its members, which are related to the activities of the British Transport Police. This could indicate a connection between the MP's query and their declared interests in ASLEF.\n\nOverall, the MP's query pertains to public sector funding and overlaps with union interests in ensuring adequate policing and worker conditions.",
