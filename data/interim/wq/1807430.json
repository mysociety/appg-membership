First, the MP has received a donation of £2,000 for campaigning purposes from Carl Michel, which could imply a potential conflict of interest if Carl Michel has any ties to the Royal Berkshire Hospital. Second, the MP holds an unpaid role as Governor at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, which may suggest vested interest in the hospital's funding but does not involve financial compensation.",
