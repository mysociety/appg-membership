The relevance arises because the MP has received a payment from JBC Defence Ltd, a company in the defense sector. Although the payment was for legal fees, the nature of JBC Defence Ltd's involvement in defense makes the relationship potentially relevant. The question could suggest a potential conflict of interest if JBC Defence Ltd, or associated entities, were granted early access, as there's a financial connection between the MP and the company.",
