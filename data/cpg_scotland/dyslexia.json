  "purpose": "The Cross-Party Group on Dyslexia aims to establish a forum whereby those affected by dyslexia and the organisations which represent their interests can share their experience and expertise and further aims to find a platform for discussion with MSPs and to keep them informed of the issues raised. The group will work towards a specific work programme to target particular issues surrounding dyslexia such as its impact on education, employment, health and offending. The group will seek to raise greater public awareness and understanding of dyslexia and promote good practice in terms of supporting those with dyslexia and giving the necessary support to individuals, families and communities affected by dyslexia.
